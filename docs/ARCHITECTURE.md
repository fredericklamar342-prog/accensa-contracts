# Architecture

Visual overview of how `ReceiptAnchor` and `RefundVault` interact on testnet.
Both contracts are independent on-chain programs that share no storage — they
are linked only by a common identifier (`payment_ref` = receipt leaf hash).

For the threat model, see [SECURITY_MODEL.md](SECURITY_MODEL.md).
For live contract IDs and verification commands, see [DEPLOYMENTS.md](../DEPLOYMENTS.md).

## System Overview

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Off-chain"
        Agent["AI Agent<br/>(buyer)"]
        MerchantAPI["Merchant API<br/>(x402 endpoint)"]
        Indexer["Go Indexer<br/>(accensa-app)"]
        Dashboard["Dashboard<br/>(accensa-app)"]
    end

    subgraph "Stellar Testnet"
        SAC["Stellar Asset Contract<br/>(XLM or USDC)"]
        subgraph "accensa-contracts"
            RA["ReceiptAnchor<br/>CBHRJU…DAPRV"]
            RV["RefundVault<br/>CCMBM4…HRQA"]
        end
    end

    MerchantAPI -->|"2. 402 Payment Required"| Agent
    Agent -->|"3. pays via SAC"| SAC
    Indexer -->|"4. reads SAC transfers"| SAC
    Indexer -->|"5. anchor_batch(root)"| RA
    Agent -->|"6. verify_receipt(leaf, proof)"| RA

```

## Receipt Anchoring Flow

The indexer aggregates individual payment receipts into a Merkle tree and
anchors the root on-chain in a single transaction. Agents can then verify
their receipt independently — no trusted API in the path.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant API as Merchant API
    participant Indexer as Go Indexer
    participant RA as ReceiptAnchor
    participant SAC as Stellar Asset Contract

    Agent->>API: HTTP request
    API-->>Agent: 402 Payment Required
    Agent->>SAC: Transfer payment
    SAC-->>Agent: Payment confirmed

    Note over Indexer: Reads SAC transfer events
    Indexer->>Indexer: Hash receipt → leaf<br/>Build Merkle tree
    Indexer->>RA: anchor_batch(root, count, period_start, period_end)
    RA-->>Indexer: batch_id

    Note over RA: Emits AnchorEvent<br/>(batch_id, root, count, …)

    Agent->>RA: verify_receipt(batch_id, leaf, proof)
    RA-->>Agent: true ✓

    Note over Agent: Proof uses sorted-pair SHA-256:<br/>siblings concatenated smaller-hash-first
```

## Refund Flow

Refunds are policy-bounded: each `payment_ref` can only be refunded once,
must fall within the refund window, and cannot exceed the vault float.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant RV as RefundVault
    participant SAC as Stellar Asset Contract

    Note over RV: Merchant pre-funded:<br/>deposit(from, amount)

    Agent->>RV: refund(payment_ref, recipient, amount, paid_at_ledger, payment_amount)

    alt Valid refund
        RV->>RV: Check cumulative + amount ≤ payment ceiling
        RV->>RV: Check within refund window and deadline
        RV->>RV: Check amount ≤ float
        RV->>SAC: Transfer tokens to recipient
        RV-->>Agent: Refund confirmed
        Note over RV: Emits RefundEvent<br/>(payment_ref, amount, fee, cumulative_refunded, recipient, ledger)
        Note over RV: Cumulative total updated in RefundV2 record<br/>(persistent storage, prevents replay)
    else Rejected
        RV-->>Agent: ExceedsPayment / WindowExpired / InsufficientFloat
    end
```

## Cross-Contract Relationship

The two contracts share no storage and have no direct function calls. They are
linked by a single shared key:

| Contract | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `ReceiptAnchor` | Merkle leaf | SHA-256 hash of the payment receipt |
| `RefundVault` | `payment_ref` | Same SHA-256 hash |

This 1:1 mapping means a refund in `RefundVault` explicitly corresponds to an
anchored receipt in `ReceiptAnchor`. The refund does **not** require the batch
to still exist — pruning or archiving a batch has no effect on refund validity.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "ReceiptAnchor"
        B1["Batch #1"]
        L1["leaf = SHA-256(receipt)"]
        B1 --> L1
    end

    subgraph "RefundVault"
        PR["payment_ref"]
        RR["RefundRecord"]
        PR --> RR
    end

    L1 == "same hash" ==> PR

    style L1 fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#fff
    style PR fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#fff
```

## Testnet Deployment Context

Both contracts are deployed on Stellar testnet (v0.1.0). Key details:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Merchant / admin | `GCALKSGAZRJLSUEJT3M5W6LN4R7XQOLIRCOS6ZA6EDZVTZDBIIPPFKJ6` |
| Refund token | Native XLM SAC (`CDLZFC3…YSC`) |
| Refund window | 17,280 ledgers (~24h) |
| Max batch size | 1,000 receipts |
| Storage TTL | ~30 days (~518,400 ledgers) |

> **Note:** The testnet contracts run v0.1.0 while `main` is at v0.2.0. The
> v0.2.0 functions (`prune_batches`, `pause`, `unpause`, etc.) are not available
> at the deployed addresses. See [DEPLOYMENTS.md](../DEPLOYMENTS.md) for details.
