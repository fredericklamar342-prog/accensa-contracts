## Trust Assumptions

### 0. Immutability of Deployed Contracts

Both `ReceiptAnchor` and `RefundVault` are **immutable**: they contain no upgrade
entry point and no call to `update_current_contract_wasm`. This is a deliberate
security property, not an omission — see
[ADR 003](ADR-003-upgradeability.md).

Consequences for the threat model:
- **No admin — including the operator — can change contract behaviour after
deployment.** A merchant can withdraw float, pause/unpause, and (via the two-step
transfer) hand over admin, but cannot install new rules or alter the refund policy
or anchoring behaviour.
- **A compromised admin key cannot rewrite wasm.** Its blast radius is bounded by
the authorisation surface the contract already encodes (drain float, pause, refund
within policy).
- **Bugs are permanent at a deployed address.** The response to a logic defect is
withdraw-and-redeploy per the migration runbook in ADR 003, not an in-place patch.

### 1. The Admin (Merchant)
The admin is assumed to be a trusted entity in the context of configuring the contract. They are responsible for:
- Initializing the `RefundVault` with the correct token address and parameters.
- Maintaining the float balance required to process refunds.
- Authorizing deposits and legitimate configuration changes.
If the admin's private key is compromised, the attacker could drain the vault's float or block refunds.

**The admin may be any `Address`, including a contract account.** On Soroban an
`Address` is not required to be a keypair — it can be a contract that implements
`__check_auth`, and `require_auth()` invokes that implementation. Both contracts
store a single `Address` as `Admin` and put no constraint on what it is, so a
`RefundVault` or `ReceiptAnchor` initialised with a multisig contract account as
its merchant already requires that account's threshold of signers for `pause`,
`unpause`, `set_refund_window`, `refund`, `withdraw`, `anchor_batch` and
`prune_batches` — with no threshold logic in this repository. This is covered by
tests in `contracts/refund-vault/tests/multisig_admin_vault.rs` and
`contracts/receipt-anchor/tests/multisig_admin_anchor.rs` (see
[`DEPLOYMENTS.md`](../DEPLOYMENTS.md#using-a-multisig-contract-account-as-admin)).

Implications for key-compromise risk when the admin is a contract account:
- **There is no single key that controls the contracts.** If the admin is a
  multisig with threshold *n*, draining the float or pausing the vault requires
  compromising *n* distinct signers, not one. The blast radius of any single
  compromised key collapses to nothing (one signer alone cannot even initiate an
  admin transfer).
- **The compromise surface moves to the account contract and its signer
  management.** The same guarantees that apply to the merchant keypair now apply
  to whatever governs the account's signer set (e.g. the account contract's own
  upgrade or signer-rotation policy). Read the account's documentation before
  relying on it as the vault's admin.
- **Signer rotation is a separate operation.** The vault's `transfer_admin`
  two-step handover is one way to move admin to a new account; the alternative is
  to rotate signers *inside* the account contract, which does not touch the vault
  at all.

### 2. The Indexer (Off-chain)
The off-chain indexer service is responsible for aggregating receipts and computing the Merkle root of the batches. 
- It is trusted to correctly hash the valid receipts and anchor the legitimate root on-chain.
- However, since users cryptographically verify their specific receipt against the on-chain root, a compromised indexer cannot forge a valid proof for a fake receipt that passes the on-chain check without brute-forcing a hash collision.

### 3. The User (Buyer)
Users are untrusted. The contracts must assume any data submitted by users could be malicious and must validate all inputs (e.g., verifying amounts are greater than zero, verifying proofs).

### 4. Refund float ownership
The float can only be funded by the merchant. `deposit` requires the depositor to be the merchant address (`from == merchant`, plus merchant auth); any other address is rejected with `Unauthorized`. This is a **deliberate guarantee**, not an implementation detail: the only funds ever at stake in the vault are the merchant's own, and a third party cannot contribute float — dust, unsolicited funding, or a top-up from a treasury contract — that the merchant has not authorised. `withdraw` is merchant-only for the same reason (it may send funds to any address the merchant chooses). A merchant who wants a finance key, treasury contract, or automated top-up to fund refunds must route those deposits through an address the merchant controls; the contract does not accept third-party funding by design.

### 5. The Yield Strategy (optional, `main` only)
The `RefundVault` yield integration (added after this document was first
written; present on `main` but not on the `0.1.0` testnet deployment) introduces
one additional trust assumption: funds deployed to a registered strategy are
trusted to that strategy's contract. The vault enforces reserve and deployment
ratios but cannot enforce strategy solvency, and the strategy is a potential
re-entrancy surface. See [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) §2 and §5 for the full treatment.

### 6. The Oracle Aggregator (optional)
The `RefundVault` oracle integration (for dynamic, SLA-based refund policies)
adds one more trust assumption: the **median** of the values reported by the
merchant-whitelisted oracles is treated as ground truth for the configured
feed. The design deliberately avoids trusting any single provider:

- The whitelist is merchant-maintained (`add_oracle` / `remove_oracle`),
  same trust tier as the yield strategy — a whitelisted oracle is a
  merchant-chosen counterparty, and a *compromised* one can only contribute
  one value to the aggregate.
- The aggregator queries **every** whitelisted oracle and takes the median
  of the fresh values, so moving the aggregated price requires controlling a
  majority of the whitelist, not one member. A single wildly-wrong value
  (e.g. a buggy or exploited provider) is neutralised.
- **Staleness filtering**: a value older than the policy's
  `max_staleness_ledgers` is excluded from the median, so a provider that
  stopped updating cannot hold the aggregate hostage at an old price.
- **Fail closed**: with no whitelist, or with every whitelisted oracle stale,
  the policy cannot be evaluated and `refund` rejects (`NoOraclesConfigured`
  / `StaleOracleData`) instead of guessing. A refund whose condition is not
  met is rejected with `OraclePolicyDenied`.
- **No catch for a panicking oracle**: a whitelisted oracle that aborts
  during `get_price` aborts the whole transaction (Soroban has no
  cross-contract catch). This is deliberate fail-closed behaviour — the
  merchant must remove the broken oracle.
- The oracle queries run inside `refund`'s reentrancy lock (the policy check
  sits in `refund_internal`, which `refund` reaches with the guard held), so
  a whitelisted oracle cannot re-enter the vault from its `get_price`
  callback.

The `OraclePolicy` (feed, threshold, staleness bound, comparison direction)
is merchant-configured and can be cleared at any time to restore purely
window-based refunds.

## Attack Vectors and Mitigations

### Replay Attacks
- **Threat:** An attacker attempts to submit the same refund request repeatedly to drain the vault.
- **Mitigation:** Refunds are cumulative: each `refund` (or each claim inside a
  `claim_batch`) for a `payment_ref`
  adds to a stored running total, and cumulative refunds may never exceed the
  original `payment_amount` supplied on the call. A call that would push the
  total past the ceiling is rejected with an `ExceedsPayment` error, and a
  record written by the legacy single-refund rule is treated the same way. There
  is no code path that pays the same amount twice for one payment, whether the
  duplicate arrives as a second `refund` or as a repeated `payment_ref` inside a
  batch.
- **Guard persistence:** This ceiling only holds while the `RefundV2` record it
  depends on is actually live. The record's TTL is now sized to the
  merchant's configured `refund_window_ledgers` (extended to the network's
  maximum TTL when the window is `0`, i.e. "no time bound") rather than a
  flat interval, so the guard cannot expire while `refund` would still accept
  a call against that payment on policy grounds — see "TTL Strategy" in
  [Storage Audit](storage-audit.md) for the mechanism and why the naive flat
  extension was silently a no-op. What remains unverified against a live
  network (only checked against this SDK's test host) is whether an entry
  that *does* go archived — i.e. outlives even the window-sized TTL, or is
  simply never restored — causes `refund` to fail closed (a host trap on
  accessing an archived entry) or fail open (a stale read). The test host
  auto-heals expired entries rather than modeling archival, so it cannot
  distinguish the two. Treat this as an open item for anyone auditing against
  testnet/mainnet directly, and see #122 for a nonce-based alternative that
  would not depend on the answer either way.

### Proof Forgery
- **Threat:** An attacker tries to claim a refund for a non-existent or altered receipt.
- **Mitigation:** The contract utilizes a sorted-pair Merkle tree. Every refund request requires a cryptographic inclusion proof that must perfectly resolve to the anchored root hash. Modifying the receipt or the proof will result in a mismatched root, causing the transaction to revert.
- **Proof length bound:** `verify_receipt` and `verify_receipt_by_root` reject proofs longer than `MAX_PROOF_LEN` (derived from `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` via `⌈log₂(MAX_BATCH_SIZE)⌉`). A proof exceeding this bound is structurally impossible for any batch this contract could have anchored, so it is rejected with `ProofTooLong` rather than consuming resources hashing an invalid input.

### Window Expiry Evasion
- **Threat:** An attacker attempts to process a refund after the designated refund window has expired.
- **Mitigation:** The contract enforces the refund window by strictly comparing the current ledger sequence against the `paid_at_ledger` plus the `RefundWindow`. If the threshold is crossed, the transaction is rejected with a `WindowExpired` error.
- **Wall-clock deadline:** The policy may additionally carry a Unix-timestamp `deadline`. `refund` rejects any claim whose current ledger timestamp is *strictly past* the deadline with `RefundExpired` (a claim landing exactly on the deadline still succeeds, mirroring the window arithmetic). A deadline of `0` (the default) disables expiry. Because the two bounds are independent, a claim must pass *both* — a window still open in ledger terms is not sufficient once the wall-clock deadline has passed.

### VDF Fairness
- **Threat:** A refund policy that gates finalization on elapsed time or on
  random selection can be gamed by a validator that controls block timestamps
  or transaction ordering — e.g. front-running a delay by backdating the
  ledger timestamp, or steering the order of refund transactions. A pure
  timestamp or ledger-sequence gate is only as honest as the validators that
  set those values.
- **Mitigation (issue #138):** a policy may carry a Verifiable Delay Function
  delay (`vdf_delay`, in squarings). When configured, every `refund`,
  `claim_batch` element, and `process_batch` item must include a valid
  **Wesolowski VDF proof** that `x^(2^T) mod N` was computed for exactly `T`
  sequential squarings. The delay is *computational*: producing the output
  requires `T` sequential modular squarings no matter how the caller or a
  validator manipulates timestamps or ordering, and the verifier's cost is
  independent of `T` (only the 128-bit challenge `l` and remainder `r` are
  ever used as exponents on-chain).
- **Payment binding and replay:** the challenge is derived on-chain as
  `x = sha256(payment_ref)`, so a proof computed for one payment cannot be
  replayed against another, and the transcript-bound prime `l` (Fiat-Shamir)
  prevents the prover from choosing the challenge after committing to `y`.
  The degenerate challenges `x ≡ 0, 1` are rejected (`InvalidVdfProof`), so a
  caller cannot "prove" a delay with zero work.
- **Modulus trust (known limitation):** the delay is only real while the
  factorization of the fixed 1024-bit modulus `MODULUS` in
  `contracts/refund-vault/src/vdf.rs` stays unknown — anyone who factors `N`
  can compute `x^(2^T) mod N` in `O(log T)` steps via `phi(N)`. The constant
  shipped in this release was generated for the source release with its prime
  factors discarded after generation; because the contracts are immutable,
  rotating the modulus requires a new deployment (ADR 003). A production
  deployment should replace `MODULUS` with one from a trusted-setup ceremony
  (ideally ≥2048 bits, which would require a larger big-int implementation
  than the SDK's 256-bit host integers — the 1024-bit arithmetic here is pure
  WASM). Treat the shipped modulus as a testnet-grade placeholder, not a
  mainnet parameter.

### Float Draining (Negative/Zero Amounts)
- **Threat:** An attacker tries to refund a negative amount to cause an underflow or steal funds.
- **Mitigation:** Explicit validation ensures that the `amount` is strictly greater than zero (`InvalidAmount` error) before executing token transfers, preventing unintended arithmetic behaviors or logical exploits.

## Balance Invariants

### RefundVault Token Balance Invariant (#94)
- **Invariant:** The total internal token balance of `RefundVault` MUST at all times equal total merchant deposits minus total processed refunds minus total merchant withdrawals:
  `Token Balance == Net Deposits - Total Refunds - Total Withdrawals`
- **Verification:** Property-based/fuzz tests (`test_fuzz_refund_vault_balance_invariant` in `contracts/refund-vault/src/fuzz_test.rs`) continuously verify this invariant across randomized series of deposits, refunds, and withdrawals.

### Self-Transfer and Phantom Refunds
- **Threat:** An indexer or batch pipeline bug supplies the contract's own address as `recipient` in `refund` or `claim_batch` (or as `to` in `withdraw`). A self-transfer leaves float untouched while permanently consuming the `payment_ref` and emitting a `RefundEvent` for funds the buyer never received.
- **Mitigation:** `refund`, every claim inside `claim_batch`, and `withdraw` explicitly validate that `recipient != env.current_contract_address()` and `to != env.current_contract_address()`, rejecting violations with `Error::SelfTransfer` before any persistent state is written or events emitted.
- **`recipient == merchant` decision:** Refunding to the merchant's own address is permitted by design. A merchant may be testing automated refund workflows, acting as buyer in self-settlement flows, or executing an explicit accounting reversal. Because float does leave the contract and transfers to the merchant balance, the transfer is real and non-phantom.

### Batch Refund Integrity
- **Threat:** A batch of refunds is only partially correct — some claims succeed while an earlier or later one fails — leaving a mix of paid and unpaid claims that an indexer can misread, or letting a batch overdraw the float one claim at a time.
- **Mitigation:** `claim_batch` is **atomic**: the first failing claim returns its error and, because a contract error reverts the whole Soroban invocation, all transfers, storage writes and events of the batch are discarded together. Either every claim persists or none do (pinned by `test_claim_batch_partial_failure_reverts_everything` and `test_claim_batch_float_checked_per_item`). The float is read fresh from the token contract before every element, so a later claim observes the reduced balance left by earlier ones and can no more overdraw the vault than the equivalent sequence of single refunds; a repeated `payment_ref` accumulates against the same ceiling across elements. Each claim still runs the full per-claim validations, so one malicious element cannot skip the checks of the rest.
- **`process_batch` is deliberately non-atomic:** it is a *best-effort* API (bounded at 100 claims) that returns a `Vec<bool>` per claim; a failing element is recorded as `false` and processing continues, so a mixed batch applies the valid claims and leaves the `false` items unrefunded (`test_process_batch_mixed_success_failure`). This is not a partial-failure vulnerability — per-element failures are contract errors localised to that element by design — but consumers must reconcile the returned booleans against their own ledger, and must use `claim_batch` whenever all-or-nothing semantics are required. Every element of `process_batch` runs the same per-claim checks as `refund`/`claim_batch`, including the deadline and fee, so a failing item can never bypass the pool of sibling items' validations.

### Refund Fee Integrity
- **Threat:** A refund fee mis-accounts for the claim, so a buyer's payout or the collector's cut is wrong — either leaking float to a fee collector or short-changing the buyer.
- **Mitigation:** The fee cannot expand a claim. `refund` computes `fee = ceil(amount × fee_bps / 10_000)` in an overflow-free decomposition and pays `payout = amount - fee` to the buyer; total outflow is exactly `amount`, so the `payment_amount` ceiling and the float check (both measured pre-fee) are unchanged. The ceiling formula always rounds **up**, so a sub-smallest-unit remainder accrues to the fee recipient rather than being lost or minted.
- **Fee recipient must not be the contract:** `set_fee_recipient` rejects the vault's own address (`SelfTransfer`), and `refund` defensively re-checks before paying, so the fee can never be a no-op transfer that "rounds up" float into nothing. When no recipient is configured, the fee defaults to the **merchant** — a deterministic, authorised destination — never to a caller-selected address.
- **Admin-only configuration:** `set_fee_bps` and `set_fee_recipient` both require merchant auth, so a third party cannot steer future fee payments.

### Token Address Changeability
- **Guarantee:** A vault initialized with an incorrect token address can be recovered via `set_token` if and only if the vault holds zero balance (`balance == 0`). If the vault contains any active float (`balance > 0`), `set_token` is rejected with `Error::FloatNotEmpty`. This allows correction of deployment-time typos without ever permitting an admin to swap the underlying asset out from under a funded vault.


## Storage Security

For details on how storage archival and persistence affect the security model (such as preventing replay attacks via persistent tombstoning), see the [Storage Audit](storage-audit.md).

## Operational Considerations

### Trustline Failures
For Classic Stellar assets wrapped in a Stellar Asset Contract (like USDC), the recipient must establish a trustline before receiving tokens. If a buyer's account lacks a trustline for the token, a `refund` will revert with a token-level `HostError`; inside a `claim_batch` such a host trap aborts the whole batch, leaving it entirely un-applied. The `RefundVault` does not pre-check trustlines because doing so would consume excess computation budget for successful refunds. Instead, this token-level panic is bubbled up and treated as an expected operational failure. Merchants issuing manual `withdraw` transactions face the same trustline requirement for the destination address.
